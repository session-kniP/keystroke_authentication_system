# keystroke_authentication_system
Simple biometric authentication system based on keystroke dynamics with database (with funny db encryption)

Let's get it started:
1.  Open folder database and execute infsec.sql MySQL script so the application could use the database
2.  Open src file DBHandler.cs and fill the static string fields with connection string parameters according to your MySQL configuration
3.  Compile and run!
